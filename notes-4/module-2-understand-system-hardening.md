# Module 2: Understand System Hardening

### Configuration Management Overview

**Configuration management** is a process and discipline used **to ensure that the only changes made to a system are those that have been authorized and validated**. It is both a decision-making process and a set of control processes. If we look closer at this definition, the basic configuration management process includes components such as **identification**, **baselines**, **updates** and **patches**.

* Configuration Management
  1. **Identification**: baseline identification of a system and all its components, interfaces and documentation.
  2. **Baseline**: a security baseline is a minimum level of protection that can be used as a reference point. Baselines provide a way to ensure that updates to technology and architectures are subjected to the minimum understood and acceptable level of security requirements.
  3. **Change Control**: An update process for requesting changes to a baseline, by means of making changes to one or more components in that baseline. A review and approval process for all changes. This includes updates and patches.
  4. **Verification & Audit**: A regression and validation process, which may involve testing and analysis, to verify that nothing in the system was broken by a newly applied set of changes. An audit process can validate that the currently in-use baseline matches the sum total of its initial baseline plus all approved changes applied in sequence.

**Effective use of configuration management gives** systems owners, operators, support teams and security professionals another important set of tools they can use to monitor and oversee the configuration of the devices, networks, applications and projects of the organization.An organization may mandate the configuration of equipment **through standards and baselines**. The use of **standards and baselines can ensure that network devices, software, hardware and endpoint devices are configured in a consistent way and that all such devices are compliant with the security baseline established for the organization**. If a device is found that is not compliant with the security baseline, it may be **disabled or isolated into a quarantine area** until it can be **checked and updated**.

* **Inventory**: Making an inventory, catalog or registry of all the information assets **is the first step in any asset management process**. **You can’t protect what you don’t know you have**.
* **Baselines**: The baseline **is a total inventory of all the system’s components, hardware, software, data, administrative controls, documentation and user instructions**. **All further comparisons and development are measured against the baselines.** **When protecting assets, baselines can be particularly helpful in achieving a minimal protection level of those assets based on value.** If classifications such as high, medium and low are being used, baselines could be developed for each of our classifications and provide that minimum level of security required for each.
* Updates: Such modifications **must be acceptance tested to verify that newly installed (or repaired) functionality works as required**. They must also be **regression tested to verify that the modifications did not introduce other erroneous or unexpected behaviors** in the system. **Ongoing security assessment and evaluation testing evaluates whether the same system that passed acceptance testing is still secure**.
* Patches: **The challenge for the security professional is maintaining all patches**. **Some patches are critical and should be deployed quickly, while others may not be as critical but should still be deployed because subsequent patches may be dependent on them**. Standards such as the **PCI DSS require organizations to deploy security patches within a certain time frame**. **An organization should test the patch before rolling it out across the organization**. If the patch does not work or has unacceptable effects, it might be necessary to **roll back to a previous (pre-patch) state**. Typically, **the criteria for rollback are previously documented and would automatically be performed when the rollback criteria were met**. The risk of using unattended patching should be weighed against the risk of having unpatched systems in the organization’s network. Unattended (or automated) patching might result in unscheduled outages as production systems are taken offline or rebooted as part of the patch process.
