# Module 4 Understand Governance and Elements and Process

### Governance Elements

When leaders and management implement the systems and structures that the organization will use to achieve its goals, they are **guided by laws and regulations created by governments to enact public policy**. **Laws and regulations guide the development of standards, which cultivate policies, which result in procedures**.

* **Procedures** are the detailed steps to complete a task that support departmental or organizational policies.
* **Policies** are put in place by organizational governance, such as executive management, to provide guidance in all activities to ensure that the organization supports industry standards and regulations.
* **Standards** are often used by governance teams to provide a framework to introduce policies and procedures in support of regulations.
* **Regulations** are commonly issued in the form of laws, usually from government (not to be confused with governance) and typically carry financial penalties for noncompliance.
