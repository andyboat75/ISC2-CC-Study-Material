# Module 2 Understand the risk management process

## Description

Risks and security-related issues represent **an ongoing concern** of businesses as well as the field of cybersecurity. Assessing and analyzing risk should be **a continuous and comprehensive** exercise in any organization. As a member of an organization’s security team, you will work through **risk assessment, analysis, mitigation, remediation and communication**.

\*\*Risk \*\* is  a measure of the extent to which an entity is threatened by a **potential** circumstance or event. It is often expressed as a combination of: the **adverse impacts that would arise if the circumstance or event occurs**,  and the **likelihood** of occurrence. 

Information security risk reflects the potential adverse impacts that result from the possibility of unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification or destruction of information and/or information systems. This definition represents that **risk is associated with threats, impact and likelihood**, and it also indicates that IT risk is a subset of business risk.

Matrix: Probability X Impact generates four possible combinations:

1. low probability, low impact
2. low probability, high impact
3. high probability, low impact
4. high probability, high impact

### Risk Management Terminology

* **An asset** is something in need of protection because it has value to the organization. It could be a tangible asset or intangible, such as information.
* **A vulnerability** is a gap or weakness in an organization's protection of its valuable assets, including information. (NIST SP 800-30). A vulnerability is an inherent weakness or flaw in a system or component, which, if triggered or acted upon, could cause a risk event to occur. An organization’s security team strives to decrease its vulnerability. To do so, **they view their organization with the eyes of the threat actor**, asking themselves, **“Why would we be an attractive target?”** The answers might provide steps to take that will discourage threat actors, cause them to look elsewhere or simply make it more difficult to launch an attack successfully. **Managing vulnerabilities starts with one simple step: Learn what they are**.
* **A threat** is something or someone that aims to exploit a vulnerability to gain unauthorized access. A threat is a person or thing that takes action to exploit (or make use of) a target organization’s system vulnerabilities, as part of achieving or furthering its goal or objectives.
* Likelihood, when determining an organization’s vulnerabilities, the security team will consider **the probability**, or likelihood , of **a potential vulnerability being exploited within the construct of the organization’s threat environment**. **Likelihood of occurrence is a weighted factor based on a subjective analysis of the probability that a given threat or set of threats is capable of exploiting a given vulnerability or set of vulnerabilities.**

Finally, the security team will consider the likely results if a threat is realized and an event occurs. Impact is the magnitude of harm that can be expected to result from the consequences of unauthorized disclosure of information, unauthorized modification of information, unauthorized destruction of information, or loss of information or information system availability.

Think about the impact and the chain of reaction that can result when an event occurs by revisiting the pickpocket scenario: **Risk comes from the intersection of those three concepts**.

### Risk Identification

In the world of cyber, **identifying risks is not a one-and-done activity**. It’s a recurring process of identifying different possible risks, characterizing them and then estimating their potential for disrupting the organization.  

Takeaways to remember about risk identification:

* Identify risk to communicate it clearly.
* Employees at all levels of the organization are responsible for identifying risk.
* Identify risk to protect against it.

As a security professional, you are likely to assist in risk assessment at a system level, focusing **on process, control, monitoring or incident response and recovery activities**. If you’re working with a smaller organization, or one that lacks any kind of risk management and mitigation plan and program, you might have the opportunity to help fill that planning void.

### Risk Assessment

Risk assessment is defined as **the process of identifying**, **estimating and prioritizing risks to an organization’s operations** (including its mission, functions, image and reputation), **assets**, **individuals**, **other organizations and even the nation**. Risk assessment should result in aligning (or associating) **each identified risk resulting from the operation of an information system with the goals, objectives, assets or processes that the organization uses, which in turn aligns with or directly supports achieving the organization’s goals and objectives**. A risk assessment can prioritize items for management to determine the method of mitigation that best suits the assets being protected. The result of the risk assessment process is **often documented as a report or presentation given to management for their use in prioritizing the identified risk(s)**. This report is provided to management for review and approval. In some cases, management may indicate a need for a more in-depth or detailed risk assessment performed by internal or external resources. 

### Risk Treatment

Risk treatment relates **to making decisions about the best actions to take regarding the identified and prioritized risk**. The decisions made are dependent on the attitude of management toward risk and the availability — and cost — of risk mitigation. The options commonly used to respond to risk are:

* Avoidance: **It is the decision to attempt to eliminate the risk entirely**. This could include ceasing operation for some or all of the activities of the organization that are exposed to a particular risk. **Organization leadership may choose risk avoidance when the potential impact of a given risk is too high or if the likelihood of the risk being realized is simply too great**.
* Acceptance: Risk acceptance is taking **no action to reduce the likelihood of a risk occurring**. Management may opt for conducting the business function that is associated with the risk **without any further action on the part of the organization**, either because the impact or likelihood of occurrence is negligible, or because the benefit is more than enough to offset that risk.
* Mitigation: Risk mitigation **is the most common type of risk management and includes taking actions to prevent or reduce the possibility of a risk event or its impact**. Mitigation can involve **remediation measures**, **or controls**, **such as security controls, establishing policies, procedures, and standards to minimize adverse risk**. Risk cannot always be mitigated, but mitigations such as safety measures should always be in place.
* Transfer: **Risk transference is the practice of passing the risk to another party**, who will accept the financial impact of the harm resulting from a risk being realized in exchange for payment. Typically, this is an insurance policy.

### Base Concepts

* Mitigation: Taking action to prevent or reduce the impact of an event
* Acceptance: Ignoring the risks and continuing risky activities
* Avoidance: Ceasing the risky activity to remove the likelihood that an event will occur
* Vulnerability: An inherent weakness or flaw
* Asset: Something of value that is owned by an organization, including physical hardware and intellectual property
* Threat: A person or an entity that deliberately takes actions to exploit a target
* Transference: Passing risk to a third party

### Risk Priorities

When risks have been identified, it is time to prioritize and analyze core risks through qualitative risk analysis and/or quantitative risk analysis. This is necessary to determine **root cause and narrow down apparent risks and core risks**. Security professionals work with their teams to conduct both qualitative and quantitative analysis.

Understanding the organization’s overall mission and the functions that support the mission helps **to place risks in context**, **determine the root causes and prioritize the assessment and analysis of these items**. In most cases, management will provide direction for using the findings of the risk assessment to determine a prioritized set of risk-response actions.

One effective method to prioritize risk is to use **a risk matrix**, which helps identify priority **as the intersection of likelihood of occurrence and impact**. It also gives the team a common language to use with management when determining the final priorities. For example, a low likelihood and a low impact might result in a low priority, while an incident with a high likelihood and high impact will result in a high priority. Assignment of priority may relate to business priorities, the cost of mitigating a risk or the potential for loss if an incident occurs.

### Decision Making Based on Risk Priorities

When making decisions based on risk priorities, organizations must evaluate the likelihood and impact of the risk as well as their tolerance for different sorts of risk. **A company in Hawaii is more concerned about the risk of volcanic eruptions than a company in Chicago, but the Chicago company will have to plan for blizzards**. In those cases, determining risk tolerance is up to the executive management and board of directors. If a company chooses to ignore or accept risk, exposing workers to asbestos, for example, it puts the company in a position of tremendous liability.

### Risk Tolerance

The perception management takes toward risk is often likened to the **entity’s appetite for risk**. **How much risk are they willing to take?** Does management welcome risk or want to avoid it? The level of risk tolerance varies across organizations, and even internally: Different departments may have different attitudes toward what is acceptable or unacceptable risk.

Understanding the organization and senior management’s attitude toward risk is usually the starting point for getting management to take action regarding risks. Executive management and/or the Board of Directors determines what is an acceptable level of risk for the organization. Security professionals aim to maintain the levels of risk within management’s limit of risk tolerance.

Often, risk tolerance is dictated by geographic location. For example, companies in Iceland plan for the risks that nearby volcanoes impose on their business. Companies that are outside the projected path of a lava flow will be at a lower risk than those directly in the path’s flow. Similarly, the likelihood of a power outage affecting the data center is a real threat in all areas of the world. In areas where thunderstorms are common, power outages may occur more than once a month, while other areas may only experience one or two power outages annually. Calculating the downtime that is likely to occur with varying lengths of downtime will help to define a company’s risk tolerance. If a company has a low tolerance of the risk of downtime, they are more likely to invest in a generator to power critical systems. A company with an even lower tolerance for downtime will invest in multiple generators with multiple fuel sources to provide a higher level of assurance that the power will not fail.
