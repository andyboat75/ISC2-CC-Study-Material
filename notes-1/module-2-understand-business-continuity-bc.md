# Module 2 Understand Business Continuity (BC)

### The Importance of Business Continuity

The intent of a **business continuity plan** is **to sustain business operations while recovering from a significant disruption**. A key part of the plan is **communication**, including multiple contact methodologies and backup numbers in case of a disruption of power or communications. Many organizations will establish a phone tree, so that if one person is not available, they know who else to call.

**Management must be included**, because sometimes priorities may change depending on the situation. Individuals with proper authority must be there to execute operations, for instance, **if there are critical areas that need to be shut down**. **We need to have at hand the critical contact numbers for the supply chain**, as well as law enforcement and other sites outside of the facility. For example, a hospital may suffer a severe cyberattack that affects communications from the pharmacy, the internet or phone lines. In the United States, in case of this type of cyberattack that knocks out communications, specific numbers in specific networks can bypass the normal cell phone services and use military-grade networks. Those will be assigned to authorized individuals for hospitals or other critical infrastructures in case of a major disruption or cyberattack, so they can still maintain essential activity.

### Components of a Business Continuity Plan

**Business continuity planning (BCP)** is the **proactive development of procedures to restore business operations after a disaster or other significant disruption to the organization**. Members from across the organization should participate in creating the BCP to ensure all systems, processes and operations are accounted for in the plan. **In order to safeguard the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information, the technology must align with the business needs**.

* List of the BCP team members, including multiple contact methods and backup members
* Immediate response procedures and checklists (security and safety procedures, fire suppression procedures, notification of appropriate emergency-response agencies, etc.)
* Notification systems and call trees for alerting personnel that the BCP is being enacted
* Guidance for management, including designation of authority for specific managers
* How/when to enact the plan. It's important to include when and how the plan will be used.
* Contact numbers for critical members of the supply chain (vendors, customers, possible external emergency providers, third-party partners)

### How often should an organization test its business continuity plan (BCP)?

Routinely. Each individual organization must determine how often to test its BCP, but it should be tested at predefined intervals as well as when significant changes happen within the business environment.



## Business Continuity in Action

What does business continuity look like in action?

_Imagine that the billing department of a company suffers a complete loss in a fire. The fire occurred overnight, so no personnel were in the building at the time. A Business Impact Analysis (BIA) was performed four months ago and identified the functions of the billing department as very important to the company, but not immediately affecting other areas of work. Through a previously signed agreement, the company has an alternative area in which the billing department can work, and it can be available in less than one week. Until that area can be fully ready, customer billing inquiries will be answered by customer service staff. The billing department personnel will remain in the alternate working area until a new permanent area is available._

In this scenario, the BIA already identified the dependencies of customer billing inquiries and revenue. Because the company has ample cash reserves, a week without billing is acceptable during this interruption to normal business. Pre-planning was realized by having an alternate work area ready for the personnel and having the customer service department handle the billing department’s calls during the transition to temporary office space. With the execution of the plan, there was no material interruption to the company’s business or its ability to provide services to its customers—indicating a successful implementation of the business continuity plan.
