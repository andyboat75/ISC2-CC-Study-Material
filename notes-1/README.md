# Chapter 2: Incident Response, Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery Concepts

## Introduction

When we're talking about IR, BC and DR, we're focus on availability, which is accomplished through those concepts.

* **Incident Response** (IR) plan responds to unexpected changes in operating conditions to keep the business operating;
* **Business Continuity** (BC) plan enables the business to continue operating throughout the crisis;
* **Disaster Recovery** (DR) plan is activated to help the business to return to normal operations as quickly as possible, if Incident Response and Business Continuity plans fail.
