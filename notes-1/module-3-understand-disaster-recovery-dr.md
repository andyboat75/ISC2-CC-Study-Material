# Module 3: Understand Disaster Recovery (DR)

### The Goal of Disaster Recovery

Disaster recovery planning **steps in where BC leaves off**. When a disaster strikes or an interruption of business activities occurs, the Disaster recovery plan (DRP) guides the actions of emergency response personnel **until the end goal is reached—which is to see the business restored to full last-known reliable operations.** Disaster recovery refers specifically to **restoring the information technology and communications services and systems needed by an organization**, **both during the period of disruption caused by any event and during restoration of normal services**. The recovery of a business function may be done independently of the recovery of IT and communications services; however, the recovery of IT is often crucial to the recovery and sustainment of business operations. Whereas business continuity planning is about maintaining critical business functions, disaster recovery planning is about restoring IT and communications back to full operations after a disruption.

### Components of a Disaster Recovery Plan

* Executive summary providing a high-level overview of the plan
* Department-specific plans
* Technical guides for IT personnel responsible for implementing and maintaining critical backup systems
* Full copies of the plan for critical disaster recovery team members
* Checklists for certain individuals:
  * Critical disaster recovery team members will have checklists to help guide their actions amid the chaotic atmosphere of a disaster.
  * IT personnel will have technical guides helping them get the alternate sites up and running.
  * Managers and public relations personnel will have simple-to-follow, high-level documents to help them communicate the issue accurately without requiring input from team members who are busy working on the recovery.
* Executive management should approve the plan and should be provided with a high-level summary of the plan.
* Public Relations should be a member of the disaster recovery plan to handle communications to all stakeholders.
* IT Personnel are primarily responsible for the disaster recovery team.
